# Trust Leak

## Description:

A mid-sized company reports suspicious activity on one of its domain controllers. A privileged account appears to have exported sensitive directory information and then attempted to remove all local traces before leaving for the weekend. The triage was taken by on-site staff after the incident. No network captures are available — everything you need is on the Triage. Answer these five questions from the evidence in the triage package. Provide the values in the exact flag format shown.

Q1 → Which tool was used to drop the executable onto the host?

Q2 → What is the SHA-1 hash of the link that was used to drop the executable?

Q3 → What was the original filename of the dumped file?

Q4 → What filename was used for exfiltration to bypass detection?

Q5 → Which tool was used to exfiltrate the file from the host?

Q6 → When did the exfiltration occur (timestamp)? Note: provide only tool names (no file extensions). Format->

CyCTF{tool_sha1(url)_secret.txt_secret2.txt_tool_YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}
