# Scenario

Advent of The Relics 4 - A Drone in the Snow
Read the campaign introduction and supporting information [here](https://github.com/hackthebox/advent-of-the-relics)

A recovered disk blew the case open. The files inside weren't theory, they were a checklist. Hours later, an unmarked matte-black drone was found half-buried in snow in Budapest, matching the recovered plans too closely to ignore. The drone is now in your lab and you've been given its mission plan and flight telemetry. Reconstruct the route, pinpoint key behavior, and prove what happened before impact, you're running out of time before the real heist begins.

The scenario portrayed in this challenge is entirely fictional and created solely for educational and entertainment purposes. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, organizations, or real events is purely coincidental and unintentional. All characters, scenarios, and data presented are products of imagination.

## Tools
- [qGroundControl](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/releases)
- [mavlogdump.py](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink/blob/master/tools/mavlogdump.py)

## lab files:

- AOTR_Winter_Blackout.plan <br>
  This file contains the drone’s settings and flight path, and which command are executed during the flight
- log.bin <br>
  This file contains the events that actually occurred during the drone’s flight.

## Task 1
#### How many total mission items are defined in the flight plan, including Home, Takeoff, and Land commands?

open file `.plan` in `qGroundControl`

<br>

start time: 48893768 <br>
hit time: 687813098

flight time = hit time - start time / 1000000
