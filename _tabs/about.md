## 👋 Hi Everyone!

My name is **Mahmoud Desokey**, a Computer Science student at the **Faculty of Education, Al-Azhar University**.

I have been actively studying **Cybersecurity** for over **two years**, with a strong focus on **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** and **SOC operations**. I am **INE ECIR v2 certified** and have hands-on experience solving DFIR labs on platforms such as **TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and CyberDefenders**, where I achieved **Top 1 Global rankings**.

I have studied **SOC Analyst** content in depth and built a comprehensive **SOC Home Lab** to simulate real-world attack and detection scenarios. The lab includes **Splunk**, **Active Directory (AD)**, **Domain Controller (DC)**, **pfSense Firewall**, **Suricata IDS/IPS**, **ModSecurity WAF**, and a vulnerable web application (**DVWA**).

Through this lab, I simulate and analyze various attack techniques, including **Active Directory attacks** and **Web Application attacks**, and perform **real-time detection** using different security solutions. I also create **custom detection rules in Splunk** to generate **alerts and dashboards**, enabling **real-time monitoring and incident detection**.

I am continuously learning and committed to improving my technical skills, with a strong passion for **defensive security, detection engineering, and incident response**.
